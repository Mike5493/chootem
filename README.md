Silly little shooter in Go based off the classic arcade game Berzerk!

WASD to move the little circle, and arrow keys to shoot. 
Enemies do not have collision yet, and is only the beginning stages. 

Fun little project the kids can play!

Will implement:
- Random map generation with my own tooling
- Increase enemy speed as you progress
- Score system to keep track of enemies killed
- Increased enemy count the farther you progress

Possible additions:
- Different bullet types
- Experiment with mouse instead of arrow key shooting
- Try out basic textures.
